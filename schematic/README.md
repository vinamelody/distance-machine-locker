5. [Adafruit Monochrome 1.3" 128x64 OLED](https://www.adafruit.com/product/938)

## Component comments

The use of a case meant for the larger Arduino is so we have extra space to accomodate the components.

OLED is optional in the operation of the device. It is just for my debugging of the sensor. I have tested the code to still work even without the OLED.
